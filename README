This package was split from darcsden into its own project; documentation
is lacking, but you can find example usage here:

http://darcsden.com/alex/darcsden/browse/src/SSHServer.hs

This is not a standalone SSH server - it is intended to be used as
a library for implementing your own servers that handle requests and
authorization, etc. Similar to Python's Twisted Conch library.
